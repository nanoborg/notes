UX - don't make people think

What does design mean to me?
- how to plan or layout
- appearance, user friendly
- personal connection to functionality 

design can be intentional or 

unintentional - observing behaviour and taking a natural course to design.

why does ux matter?
 reduce - wasted rework and development time
 increase sales - brand credibility
 prioritize people -
