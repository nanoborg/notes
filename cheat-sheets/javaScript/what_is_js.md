- its a high level, interpreted programming language
script language does not to be interpreted

- conforms to the ECMAScript spec

- multi paradigm 
programming style oop or functional. flexibility.

- front end client side and back end / server / node
form validation
data base API

variables
arrays
object literals
methods for strings, arrays, objects
loops
conditionals
functions
oop (prototypes and classes)
DOM selection
DOM manipulation
events
basic form validation


chrome dev tools
- console / REPL
- methods for console log, error, timestamp, warn

variables
var let and const
- var global scope
- let reassign value
- const can not be changed

data types
- primitive data is directly assigned to memory. not a resource
- js dont have to declare the date type (static type)
string, numbers boolean, null, undefined


Strings
- `` template strings or template literals
- methods () // functions associated with that particular object
- properties can be used on a data type with no parenthesis

Arrays
- zero based in every language
- access elements with [0]

Objects
- object literals
- can change the date inside but not the name
- access with object.key

Loops
- for
- while
- for of
- high order array methods 
- call back functions - 
- forEach, 

- map, filter // chain them together to get different results, functional 

conditionals
- if statement
- == only to match value not data type
- === match value and data type
- || or operator, one of the conditions to match
- && and operator, all of the conditions need to match
- ternary operator, short hand if statement (assign variable based on condition)
- switch


functions
- declaration
- arrow function
- default arguments
- return / console log results

oop / object orientated programming
- constructor functions, prototypes ES6 classes
- instantiated methods stored prototypes.
- classes are exactly the same, syntactic sugar to make it look familiar

DOM
- Document object model, tree structure of your document. HTML
- window, parent object of the browser
